            FUME is an open source software intended primarily for the preparation of emissions for chemical transport models.
            As such, FUME is responsible for preprocessing the input files and the spatial distribution, chemical speciation,
            and time disaggregation of the primary emission inputs. The main characteristics of FUME are:
            <ul>
                <li> PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and Python based (for minimum versions see model documentation);
                <li> flexible and configurable tool for emissions processing; 
                <li> independent on specific input data;
                <li> applicable in different scales (local / regional / continental);
                <li> not limited to any geographical coordinate systems;
                <li> configurable chains of emissions processing;
                <li> easy implementation of new modules;
                <li> easy involvement of specialised external models (e.g. for biogenic emissions) through common interface;
                <li> outputs usable for different types of models / application;
                <li> allowing for output also on irregular grids and general polygons;
                <li> reporting and QA/QC.
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            FUME is being currently used for the air quality modelling in the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute
            and in several projects: <a href="https://powietrze.malopolska.pl/en/life-ip/">LIFE-IP Malopolska</a>
            (action C.6, project reference LIFE14 IPE/PL/000021) and
            <a href="https://www.mff.cuni.cz/to.en/verejnost/konalo-se/2018-01-urbi/">URBI PRAGENSI</a>
            (project reference CZ.07.1.02/0.0/0.0/16_040/0000383).
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite of intensive work on its development, there are still some issues that need to be finished, mainly:
            <ul>
                <li> improvement of documentation;
                <li> increase of the computational efficiency;
                <li> user-friendly usage / reporting / logging;
                <li> additional possibilities to process emissions (e.g. provide emissions with proxy data for spatial disaggregation).
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore we hope that interested users will not be discouraged by some initial difficulties / inconvenience
            that are an inevitable part of the newly developed software. We will be happy if you  provide us with feedback
            and we will try to provide you maximum support within our limited time resources.
